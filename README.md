    I was enrolled in UTN (national technological university in Argentina) for a programming specialization in 2020, but the quarentine and the lost of conectivity (Literally the telephone landlines and internet cable was looted) forced me to return as a autodidact. 

    Mi proficiency in english is: shameful. Because of that, all my comments are in spanish.
